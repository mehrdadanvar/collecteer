# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`  
this is a sample :[red]title

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

at the command prompt type  
`npm install ct-sraper`

```
let x = [1,2,3]
x.forEac((item)=>{console.log(item**2)})
```
